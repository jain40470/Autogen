    "   - Everything happens step-by-step in a fixed order.\n",
    "   - 👨‍💻 In LangChain:\n",
    "        - The LLM reads the user’s question.\n",
    "        - It identifies that math is involved.\n",
    "        - It calls a calculator tool.\n",
    "        - The result is returned and the answer is shown.\n",
    "        - All of this happens in sequence, like links in a chain.\n",
